create table EMPLOYEE.A(id number,  
               name varchar(20));

create or replace table B(id number(32,5),                ---- here schema not specified so it can create under public schema
                          salary number,

-- precision, scale: These are the parameters that can be passed with various datatypes such as number
                    -- Precision is the length of string/number that column can have
                    -- Scale is the number of digits that will be allowed after (.)
                    -- Example: number(38,5) shows that precision is 38 and scale is 5
                   ------ it can allows 38 characters of number and in decimal it can allows upto 5 characters

--------create file format and stage object---------------


--- if you want to consume the data from the external source such as aws,azure or gcp these are 3 cloud data providers that are supported by snowflake. if you want to consume the data from either of these cloud providers means the data is residing out of snowflake which means an external connection that is trying to send the data to snowflake.



-- Create parquet format
create or replace file format db.public.parquet_format
  type = 'parquet';

  ------parquet file is used to 90 percent compressed data campared to csv suppose if a csv file taking 10mb of your space then parquet file compresses the data up to 90 percent means it take about 1 to 1.25mb for the similar data.

------now stage object is again use to ingest the data from AWS. so these are the some of the configuration we have to done before ingestin data from AWS or it can be other cloud platforms as well.

-- Create stage object
create or replace stage db.public.mystage
  file_format = db.public.parquet_format; ---here spedified the stage created under which file format

----now awe are ready to consume the data fro external sources to the stage then we can take the data from stage to snowflake tables.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----create views-------
// create view
-- a materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query.
-- For example, it may be a local copy of data located remotely,
--      or may be a subset of the rows and/or columns of a table or join result, or may be a summary using an aggregate function

----view are the containers which contains the results of a every query you can run inside the sqldatabase it can be snowflake or can be other databases like mysql or any what heppens when we runs a query we get some results(it can be complex quey with multiple joins or simple query). but if the query is very complex, you can just snapshot of a data which is coming on base of some filters or may be after joining multiple tables at this case you have to run the code again and again using big complete sql script but what you do now using sql views you can wrap that complete query wrap that complete code what you have written inside the view then you can return fetch out the data directly from a view.


create view myview as
    select *
    from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF100"."CUSTOMER"
    where c_custkey <= 5;

select *
    from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF100"."CUSTOMER"


select * from myview;



---- To know more about snowflake views, refer to below URL:
-- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-view.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----alter virtual warehouse------------
----------------- ALTER -----------------
-- alter the structure of the objects

------ ALTER WAREHOUSE
  -- Suspends or resumes a virtual warehouse, or aborts all queries (and other SQL statements) for a warehouse.
  -- Can also be used to rename or set/unset the properties for a warehouse.
 
-- To suspend a warehouse
alter warehouse test suspend;

alter warehouse test resume;

-- if warehouse is in suspended state, we can resume it by running below statement
alter warehouse test resume if suspended;

-- abort all queries running in warehouse
alter warehouse compute_wh abort all queries;

-- rename warehouse name
alter warehouse compute_wh rename to computer_wh;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----working with roles and users----------
---for example there is a snowflake acoount in your organization. and there are multiple employees who want to use the snowflake account, so how snowflake works is if you want to create the different user accounts, you can create the user and just give them the url and their default password and username.
--suppose we have creted 10 accounts for 10 different employees then we dont want to likegive them access each database, all the schemas , all the tables
-----providing privileges to specific objects is possible for suppose employee x wants the data of table a and employee y wants data on table b. so these objects specific privileges can be granted to each user. its is not required to privde the access to complete data. so that you dont lose thedata and the data is not misused.just provide the access to specific users respective to the department and present they are working on.




-- Create ROLE and USER. Then grant privileges.
-- role are simply the collection of privileges that we can grant to a user.
--- there is one more layer before assigning the privileges to user, suppose there are 5 users to which similar kind of privileges need to be assigned . we can create roles in that case. suppose role A has specific privileges to access the data from db database and role B has privileges to access data from company database and role C has privileges to access to some other database, similarly we can create different roles on different database and then assign this role to a user so that all the privileges that have been granted to this role will be automatically granted to that user.


CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE TEST_ROLE;
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS TEST_ROLE;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE DB TO ROLE TEST_ROLE;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA EMPLOYEE TO ROLE TEST_ROLE;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE A TO ROLE TEST_ROLE; -----need to specify the schema
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE EMPLOYEE.A TO ROLE TEST_ROLE;



USE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;
USE ROLE TEST_ROLE;

GRANT ROLE TEST_ROLE TO USER Dinesh;


CREATE OR REPLACE USER TEST_USER PASSWORD = 'ABC123' DEFAULT_ROLE = 'PUBLIC' MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE;

// GRANT PRIVILEGES TO ROLE
-- Grants one or more access privileges on a securable object to a role.
-- The privileges that can be granted are object-specific and are grouped into the following categories:
    -- Global privileges
    -- Privileges for account objects (resource monitors, virtual warehouses, and databases)
    -- Privileges for schemas
    -- Privileges for schema objects (tables, views, stages, file formats, UDFs, and sequences)


// GRANT ROLE
    -- Assigns a role to a user or another role:
    -- Granting a role to another role creates a “parent-child” relationship between the roles (also referred to as a role hierarchy).
    -- Granting a role to a user enables the user to perform all operations allowed by the role
        -- (through the access privileges granted to the role).

alter warehouse computer_wh rename to compute_wh;

------ ALTER DATABASE

-- Modifies the properties for an existing database, including the following:

    -- Changing the name of the database or changing the Time Travel data retention period 

                -- (only available in ENTERPRISE or BUSINESS CRITICAL snowflake editions)

    -- Enabling and managing database replication and failover.



ALTER DATABASE IF EXISTS COMPANY RENAME TO PRODUCTION;

ALTER DATABASE IF EXISTS PRODUCTION RENAME TO COMPANY;



------ ALTER SCHEMA

-- Modifies the properties for an existing schema, including renaming the schema or swapping it with another schema, 

    // and changing the Time Travel data retention period

    

ALTER SCHEMA IF EXISTS EMPLOYEE RENAME TO EMPL;



create or replace schema employee;

create schema if not exists department;

create or replace table db.employee.empl_details(empl_id number);

create or replace table db.department.dept_details(dept_id number);





ALTER SCHEMA IF EXISTS DB.DEPARTMENT SWAP WITH DB.EMPLOYEE;



ALTER SCHEMA IF EXISTS DB.DEPARTMENT SWAP WITH DB.EMPLOYEE; ----2 nd time to get the tables under respected schema



ALTER SCHEMA IF EXISTS DB.DEPARTMENT

SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 2,

    COMMENT = 'DEPARTMENT DETAILS SCHEMA';

    

SELECT * FROM "DB"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."SCHEMATA"

WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'DEPARTMENT';

    

show schemas;

    

------ ALTER TABLE

-- Modifies the properties, columns, or constraints for an existing table.



ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS DEPARTMENT.DEPT_DETAILS RENAME TO DEPARTMENT_DETAILS;



ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS EMPLOYEE.DEPARTMENT_DETAILS RENAME TO DEPARTMENT.DEPARTMENT_DETAILS;

---changing location of the table



create or replace table db.department.department_employees(dept_id number,

                                                               empl_name varchar(40));

                                                               

ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS DB.DEPARTMENT.DEPARTMENT_DETAILS SWAP WITH DB.DEPARTMENT.DEPARTMENT_EMPLOYEES;

-----the columns have been swapped.



----------------- DROP -----------------

-- delete objects from the database permenently.



drop table employee.empl_details; ----while we are doing with any to table we have to specify schema name.

drop schema db.empl;

drop database company;

drop warehouse test;

drop view db.public.myview;

drop stage if exists mystage;

drop file format if exists parquet_format;



----------------- TRUNCATE -----------------

-- remove all records from a table, including all memory spaces allocated for the records are removed

---truncate can be applied to table not database or schema.

---drop is completely deleting the object,it doesnot restorable once it dropped.

---truncate deletes the data/records inside the table but it retains the structure of the table means all the columns that are there in the table will retained and all the metadata will be retained.



TRUNCATE TABLE DB.PUBLIC.A;

TRUNCATE TABLE IF EXISTS DB.DEPARTMENT.DEPARTMENT_DETAILS;



----------------- COMMENT -----------------

---comment is very useful because once your data is grown to good level lke multiple databases , schemas and hundreds of tables are there, at a certain point of level it becames very difficult for you to idetify like which table have which kind of data but while creating a table if you specifically mention that this kind of table contains this kind of data

---for eg:suppose there is an order table, you can give a comments like this table contains orders from certain date to certain date or for an employees table this table contains the information of x organisation.









-- add comments to the data dictionary

-- overwrites an existing comment for an existing object.

-- can be added to all objects (users, roles, warehouses, databases, tables, etc.). 

-- can be added to individual table columns as well.



COMMENT IF EXISTS ON SCHEMA DB.DEPARTMENT IS 'TEST Department Schema xyz';



SHOW SCHEMAS LIKE 'DEPARTMENT';



DESC SCHEMA DEPARTMENT;



COMMENT IF EXISTS ON TABLE DB.DEPARTMENT.DEPARTMENT_EMPLOYEES IS 'ALL ABOUT DEPARTMENT DETAILS';



SHOW TABLES LIKE 'DEPARTMENT_EMPLOYEES';----- change schema to department and execute



DESC TABLE DB.DEPARTMENT.DEPARTMENT_EMPLOYEES;



select * from "DB"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES" where table_Schema = 'DEPARTMENT';



select count(distinct table_name) from "DB"."INFORMATION_SCHEMA"."TABLES" where table_Schema = 'DEPARTMENT';
